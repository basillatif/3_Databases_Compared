# 3 Databases Compared
The model of a database is the underlying structure for how data is stored in each database system. For my CMSI 402 capstone project, I will be importing data into 3 different databases each with a different model and evaluating their performance. The goal of this project will be to examine the differences and witness firsthand the advantages and disadvantages of each database model. I will using a traditional relational database, a NoSQL database, and a graph database. 

A relational database uses the relational model that is reliant upon first-order predicate logic. All relational databases models use the Structured Query Language (SQL) to access the database. I will be using PostgreSQL as my standard SQL database engine. 

  In contrast, sometimes a relational model may not be the best tool to solve the problem. NoSQL databases do not have fixed table structures; thus, they have a simple more flexible structure. The downside to NoSQL's flexibility is that they are not as reliable as relational databases and do not support atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) properties. The NoSQL branch of databases offers many different data models to choose from like column, document, key-value, and graph databases.
 

# Key criteria: 
* Ease at which database was set up
* Speed at which queries get results
* Simplicity of query language
