# 3_Databases_Compared
The model of a database is the underlying structure for how data is stored in each database system. For my CMSI 402 capstone project, I will be importing data into 3 different databases and evaluating their performance. The goal of this project will be to examine the differences and witness firsthand the advantages and disadvantages of each database model. I will using a traditional relational database, a NoSQL database, and a graph database. 

A relational database uses the relational model that is reliant upon first-order predicate logic. All relational databases models use the Structured Query Language (SQL) to access the database. Therefore, I will be using PostgreSQL as my standard SQL database engine. 

  In contrast, sometimes a relational model may not be the best tool to solve the problem. The NoSQL branch of databases offers many different data models to choose from like column, document, key-value, and graph databases. NoSQL databases offer the advantage of allowing for quick processing of bigger datasets. 

# Key criteria: 
* Ease at which database was set up
* Speed at which queries get results
* Simplicity of query language

-Dynamo
-HBase


I will also be exploring using an AWS
